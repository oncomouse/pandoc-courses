## Generative AI Usage Statement

We in the Department of English believe that writing is central to the production of knowledge. The written word is how ideas circulate but, more importantly, the act of crafting words, sentences, paragraphs, and essays refines thoughts into ideas that matter. As such, we strongly stand against the usage of generative artificial intelligence—applications such as ChatGPT or Grammarly—as a replacement for the act of writing that has been the bedrock of human knowledge for thousands of years. Given the concerns delineated below and the importance I place on writing as your thought process, the use of GenAI in this class will be treated as plagiarism. As such, any usage of GenAI will be subject to the university's academic integrity policy, which may include, but is not limited to, failing the assignment and/or disciplinary action.

## University Writing Center Statement
